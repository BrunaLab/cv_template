	abstract = {Premise: After deforestation, environmental changes in the remaining forest fragments are often most intense near the forest edge, but few studies have evaluated plant growth or plasticity of plant growth in response to edge effects. Methods: In a 2-year common garden experiment, we compared biomass allocation and growth of Heliconia acuminata with identical genotypes grown in 50 x 35 m common gardens on a 25-year-old edge and in a forest interior site. Key results: Genetically identical plants transplanted to the forest edge and understory exhibited different patterns of growth and biomass allocation. However, individuals with identical genotypes in the same garden often had very different responses. Plants on forest edges also had higher growth rates and increased biomass at the end of the experiment, almost certainly due to the increased light on the forest edge. Conclusions: With over 70 000 km of forest edge created annually in the Brazilian Amazon, phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in mediating plant responses to these novel environmental conditions.},

However, few studies have quantified the growth of plants that persist in fragments. Over the course of a decade, we measured annual growth of 5200 individuals of the common understory herb Heliconia acuminata (Heliconiaceae) in an experimentally fragmented Amazonian forest. We tested (A) whether annual growth rates were lower in fragments than in continuous forest, and (B) whether cumulative growth rates of plants that survived the entire period were lower in fragments. While mean annual growth rates were often lower in fragments, differences were not significant in any year. After 10 years, however, the cumulative effect was that plants in fragments were significantly smaller. This had a clear demographic consequence - plants in fragments produced fewer inflorescences than plants in continuous forest. Our results demonstrate that chronic reduced individual growth may be an important mechanism contributing to reduced population viability in fragmented forests, and that negative demographic consequences of fragmentation for plants can take years to manifest themselves.

	volume = {144},
	abstract = {We synthesize findings to date from the world's largest and longest-running experimental study of habitat fragmentation, located in central Amazonia. Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes: such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.

	abstract = {In the tropics, several ant species are obligate inhabitants of leaf pouches and other specialized structures in plants known as myrmecophytes. However, the cues used by ant queens to locate suitable host-plants following dispersal remain poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Pheidole minutula queens use volatiles to distinguish their host Maieta guianensis (Melastomataceae) from other sympatric myrmecophytes. To do so, we used a Y-tube olfactometer to quantify the preference for volatiles of different plant species. Our results indicate that P. minutula queens discriminate the chemical volatiles produced by its host-plant from those of other sympatric ant-plant species. However, queens failed to distinguish the volatiles of Maieta from those of the ant-plant Tococa bullifera (Melastomataceae), with which P. minutula is not mutualistically associated. Nevertheless, a strong preference for Maieta over Tococa was observed during a subsequent bioassay, where the ants had physical contact with a domatium of each plant species. These results suggest that additional, short distance mechanisms are also necessary for host discrimination. Overall, our findings suggest that the high degree of compartmentalization observed in symbiotic ant-plant relationships is achieved, at least in part, by the relatively high degree of specificity in host selection displayed by foundress queens.},

We tested the hypothesis that dirt roads are favorable landing and nest initiation sites for founding-queens of the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata. For 2 yr, we compared the number of attempts to found new nests (colonization attempts) in dirt roads and the adjacent vegetation in a reserve of cerrado (tree-dominated savanna) in southeastern Brazil. The number of colonization attempts in roads was 5 to 10 times greater than in the adjacent vegetation. Experimental transplants indicate that founding-queens are more likely to establish a nest on bare soil than on soil covered with leaf-litter, but the amount of litter covering the ground did not fully explain the preference of queens for dirt roads. Queens that landed on roads were at higher risk of predation by beetles and ants than those that landed in the adjacent vegetation. Nevertheless, greater predation in roads was not sufficient to offset the greater number of colonization attempts in this habitat. As a consequence, significantly more new colonies were established in roads than in the adjacent vegetation. Our results suggest that disturbance caused by the opening of roads could result in an increased Atta abundance in protected areas of the Brazilian Cerrado.},

On entering the workforce, however, graduates find they are required to work beyond disciplinary boundaries to address the complex interconnectivity between biological conservation and human well-being. We devised a framework for graduate education that broadens students' skill sets to learn outside their immediate disciplines and think in terms of linked socioecological systems, work in teams, communicate in nonacademic formats, and reflect critically on their own perspectives and actions. The University of Florida's Tropical Conservation and Development program has adopted a learning and action platform that blends theory, skills, and praxis to create an intellectual, social, and professionally safe space where students, faculty, and other participants can creatively address the complex challenges of tropical conservation and development. This platform operates within a nondegree granting program and includes core courses that are taught by a team of biophysical and social scientists. It incorporates a range of alternative learning spaces such as student-led workshops, retreats, visiting professionals, practitioner experiences, and a weekly student-led seminar that collectively encourage students and faculty to enhance their skills and systematically and thoroughly reflect on program activities. Challenges to the described approach include increased service demands on faculty, a redefinition of research excellence to include effective and equitable collaboration with host-country partners, and the trade-offs and uncertainties inherent in more collaborative, interdisciplinary research. Despite these challenges, growing interdisciplinary programs, coupled with adaptive educational approaches that emphasize learning and action networks of students, faculty, and field partners, provide the best hope for responding to the emerging challenges of tropical conservation and development.},

	title = {Evaluating conceptual models of landscape change},
	volume = {40},
	abstract = {A variety of landscape models are used to conceptualize and interpret human impacts on ecosystems and their biodiversity. The simplest, a 'patch-matrix' model, is rooted in island biogeography theory and assumes a dichotomy between generic, easily-defined habitat patches and a surrounding matrix that is completely inhospitable. This dichotomy between patch and matrix habitats has been recently relaxed, with the 'continuum' model taking this relaxation to its extreme and logical endpoint - a species-based model with no a priori definition of habitat or matrix, but rather focusing on ecological gradients. Yet, because few empirical comparisons of these bookending models exist, we lack understanding of their relative utility or the merits of hybrid approaches that combine attributes of patch-matrix and continuum models. To guide such considerations, we first develop a decision-making framework for the application of patch-matrix, continuum, and hybrid models. The framework takes into account study objectives, attributes of the landscape, and species traits. We then evaluate this framework by empirically comparing how continuum, patch-matrix, and hybrid models explain beetle distributions across two contrasting fragmented landscapes, for species differing in trophic level and habitat specificity. Within the Hope River Forest Fragmentation Project, a system with strong landscape contrast and distinct ('hard') structural edges between forest fragments and grassland, we find broad support for hybrid models, particularly those incorporating surrounding landscape structure. Conversely, within the Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment, a system with weak landscape contrast and 'soft' structural edges between natural and plantation forest, we find co-support for continuum and hybrid models. We find no support in either system for patch-matrix, relative to continuum and hybrid models. We conclude by considering key questions and areas of research for advancing the application of models to understand species responses and biodiversity patterns associated with land-use change.},

	abstract = {The clearing and fragmentation of terrestrial ecosystems is commonly acknowledged as a major cause of the decline of biodiversity. These and other predicted responses to habitat fragmentation are derived from theory, which ecologists have tested with empirical approaches ranging from observations to experimental manipulations. These empirical approaches have also identified areas of theory in need of additional development. For example, experimental studies of fragmentation have provided insights such as the key role played by the matrix surrounding fragments, the importance of edge effects, and the impacts of corridors linking fragments with one another. Much less clear, however, is the extent to which these theoretical and empirical studies - while advancing our conceptual understanding of ecological responses to landscape change - help guide management and conservation practice. We review lessons learned from landscape-scale fragmentation experiments and observational studies, present the results of a survey of fragmentation and conservation experts which probed for links and mismatches between fragmentation studies and conservation practice, and discuss how future studies can contribute to conservation practice. Our survey showed that respondents consider fragmentation theory and empirical studies and their findings important for guiding conservation and management practices. The survey also identified that there are disconnects between what is typically studied by fragmentation ecologists and factors that are central to the practice of biodiversity conservation, notably, community-based human dimensions (e.g. economic, social, health issues), policy and governance, ecosystem services, eco-evolutionary responses of species, and interaction of multiple threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We discuss how these disconnects can present opportunities for experiments to continue to provide valuable recommendations for conservation practice in fragmented landscapes.},

	title = {Effect of mutualist partner identity on plant demography},
	volume = {95},
	abstract = {Mutualisms play a central role in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Because many mutualisms have strong demographic effects, interspecific variation in partner quality could have important consequences for population dynamics. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified how a mutualist partner influences population growth rates, and still fewer have compared the demographic impacts of multiple partner species. We used integral projection models parameterized with three years of census data to compare the demographic effects of two ant species, Crematogaster laevis and Pheidole minutula, on populations of the Amazonian ant plant Maieta guianensis. Estimated population growth rates were positive (i.e., lambda {\textgreater} 1) for all ant-plant combinations. However, populations with only Pheidole minutula had the highest asymptotic growth rate (lambda = 1.23), followed by those colonized by Crematogaster laevis (lambda = 1.16), and in which the partner ant alternated between C. laevis and P. minutula at least once during our study (lambda = 1.15). Our results indicate that the short-term superiority of a mutualist partner (in this system, P. minutula is a better defender of plants against herbivores than C. laevis) can have long-term demographic consequences. Furthermore, the demographic effects of switching among alternative partners appear to be context dependent, with no benefits to plants hosting C. laevis but a major cost of switching to plants hosting P. minutula. Our results underscore the importance of expanding the study of mutualisms beyond the study of pair-wise interactions to consider the demographic costs and benefits of interacting with different, and multiple, potential partners.},

	volume = {91},
	abstract = {Studies simultaneously evaluating the importance of safe-site and seed limitation for plant establishment are rare, particularly in human-modified landscapes. We used spatially,explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km(2) to (1) evaluate the relative importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects May be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators.},

	abstract = {In myrmecophytes, plants with structures in which ants establish colonies, there is strong competition among ant queens for access to host plants. However, our knowledge of how queens of different partner species interact when attempting to colonize plants remains limited. The Amazonian myrmecophyte Maieta guianensis is colonized by queens of two ant species: Crematogaster laevis and Pheidole minutula. We elucidated the competitive ranking of queens of these species and tested the hypothesis that cooperative colony founding (pleometrosis) by P. minutula queens could alter this ranking. We found that C. laevis queens are behaviorally dominant to P. minutula when individual queens encounter each other. Despite being inferior in combat, however, P. minutula queens successfully colonized seedlings at similar rates whether they were placed alone or in concert with a C. laevis queen. This may have occurred because the smaller P. minutula queens frequently entered domatia before the more robust C. laevis queens. Although C. laevis queens can evict P. minutula queens that had previously colonized domatia, this was an infrequent phenomenon-perhaps because while not fatal, conflicts often resulted in serious injury. Furthermore, by colonizing the same plant cooperative P. minutula queens dramatically reduce the probability that C. laevis colonizes host-plants without reducing their own per capita rates of colonization success. To our knowledge, this is a novel benefit of pleometrosis, whose primary advantages have primarily been thought to occur after the critical stage of colony establishment. Given the decreased likelihood of colonization when faced with multiple P. minutula, it may be that C. laevis' persistence at the landscape level is enhanced by such factors as priority effects, superior dispersal ability, or niche partitioning.},

	title = {Roads increase population growth rates of a native leaf-cutter ant in {Neotropical} savannahs},
	volume = {53},
	abstract = {A challenge in applied ecology is understanding the responses of native species to roads, which are ubiquitous drivers of environmental heterogeneity. While most studies highlight their negative effects, the potential for native species to increase in abundance near roads has been underappreciated, and the demographic mechanisms underlying abundance changes remain unclear. Elucidating these mechanisms requires first determining how demographic vital rates and life-history stages interact to influence population growth. One can then assess how roads alter the relative importance of the alternative demographic pathways - increased performance of early vs. late life stages - suggested as the principal drivers of increased population growth. We parameterized demographic models with 3years of census data and conducted perturbation analyses to evaluate how proximity to roads altered abundance and demography. To do so, we used the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata as our model organism. Leaf-cutters are native ecosystem engineers and dominant herbivores in Neotropical ecosystems and also amongst the longest lived insects in nature. Our study was conducted in Cerrado savannahs, where road networks are rapidly expanding and Atta species are major agricultural pests. We found that 35-45\% of adult colonies were located within 15m of roads, which is significantly closer than expected at random. Population growth rates () were {\textgreater}1 both near and far from roads, but near roads were significantly (41\%) higher. Elasticities of to early survival and growth rates were proportionally much higher than those of adult stages, irrespective of habitat. Life-table response experiment results indicate that the higher near roads was due primarily to the much higher colonization and early-life performance there.Synthesis and applications. Road networks are proliferating throughout biodiversity-rich regions. Developing conservation and management guidelines for species whose abundance is altered by roads requires understanding the demographic mechanisms that underpin these changes. We demonstrate that the higher growth rate of roadside Atta laevigata populations is due to increased early-life performance. Thus, the expansion of road networks could have major ecological and economic consequences by facilitating the increased abundance of ecosystem engineers and agricultural pests. Accounting for A.laevigata early life stages and careful planning of road placement should improve management strategies of protected areas and agricultural systems in Neotropical savannahs.},

	volume = {105},
	abstract = {1. Herbivory has been shown to have prominent top-down effects on vegetation in Paleotropical savannas, where consumers of early stages of life history act as demographic bottlenecks. Such impact has been largely ignored in Neotropical savannas, however, despite insect consumption being linked to reduced recruitment of woody species. 2. We hypothesize that Atta leaf-cutter ants -the prevalent herbivores in the Neotropics -alter the establishment of woody plant seedlings in the Brazilian Cerrado by reducing seed availability and seedling survival. We also hypothesize that the demographic effects will be species-specific. 3. To test these hypotheses, we experimentally (i) compared seed removal in areas with and without Atta foraging and (ii) compared the survivorship of seedlings exposed to or protected from Atta foraging. Both experiments were performed with the same common Cerrado species which allowed us to evaluate the potential net effects of consumers at the population and community levels. 4. Overall seed removal rates in sites with Atta foraging were greater than those where ants were absent (59.2\% and 39.2\% of seeds removed, respectively). There were differences in removal for 10 of the 12 tested species, with per species removal 1.1-to 3.8-fold greater in areas with Atta foraging. On transplanted plants, 45\% of seedlings exposed to Atta were attacked, resulting in a survival 7.6\% lower than that of protected seedlings. Seedling survival was 11.8-31.5\% lower in five species, with the largest differences in survival between treatments during the dry season. 5. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that consumers can lead to demographic bottlenecks in Neotropical savanna plant species, with effects varying among life-history stages and between species. 6. Synthesis. Granivory by ants has been linked to reduced seedling recruitment of woody species in the Brazilian Cerrado. Our results show that leaf-cutter ants may largely limit early seedling establishment of woody species by reducing seed availability and seedling survival with differential species- specific effects. Atta ants may therefore be acting as an ecological filter, which coupled with potential selectivity in foraging on reproductive life-history stages, may ultimately influence the relative abundance of different species and hence the structure and composition of Cerrado vegetation.},

	abstract = {1 Variation in antiherbivore defences among individuals within a plant species may be influenced by intrinsic characteristics of the plant, environmental conditions and the interactions between these factors. 2 We used a long-term field experiment and a laboratory palatability trial to elucidate the effects of plant age, nutrient availability and ant occupancy on herbivore damage sustained by Cordia alliodora, a common neotropical myrmecophyte. 3 Herbivory in this system was influenced by both plant characteristics and environmental conditions, and the relative importance of these variables changed with plant age. 4 Five-year-old plants had a higher frequency of ant occupation and more workers per domatium than 1-year-old plants. 5 Plant age did not significantly affect herbivory in either field studies or laboratory palatability trials conducted with a specialist herbivore. In the field, however, 1-year-old plants tended to have higher levels of herbivory than 5-year-old plants. 6 There was a trend towards lower herbivory in trees that had been fertilized. Additionally, leaves from fertilized trees were significantly less palatable to specialist herbivores. 7 In 1-year-old plants, the abundance of ants in domatia had no effect on herbivory of nearby leaves. In contrast, ant abundance and herbivory were negatively correlated for 5-year-old trees, demonstrating that ants provide effective defence only for older plants. 8 These results suggest that understanding ant-plant-herbivore relationships requires examining how biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions change with plant ontogeny. Although our work focused on one particular ant-plant system, the importance of ontogenetic variation in antiherbivore defence is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study in plant defence theory.},

We found that there is a major disparity between the ecological processes and stages of life history with large demographic impacts and the focus of empirical research on plants in fragmented habitats. While the growth and survivorship of large, established individuals have the highest elasticity values, the focus of empirical research has been on components of reproduction and seedling dynamics. We argue that elucidating the demographic mechanisms underlying population declines in fragmented habitats, and developing strategies for mitigating these declines, will be challenging without a greater focus on understanding how fragmentation alters adult plant growth and survivorship.},

	abstract = {Question: Plant communities in Paleotropical savannas are regulated by a combination of bottom-up and top-down effects. However, the paucity of ungulates and other large herbivores in Neotropical savannas has led to speculation that these communities are primarily structured by physical factors such as fire, precipitation and soil chemistry. We addressed the following question: How much plant biomass is consumed by leaf-cutter ants in Neotropical savannas, and is it comparable to the amount of biomass consumed by herbivores in Paleotropical savanna sites? Location: Our study was conducted at the Estacao Ecologica do Panga, located 30 km south of Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil. All field work was conducted in the vegetation type known as cerrado sensu stricto. Methods and Results: Using direct measurements of herbivory, coupled with estimates of plant productivity and ant colony density, we found that leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.) consume 13-17\% of the foliar biomass produced annually by woody plants in a Neotropical savanna (Brazilian cerrado). Although comparisons with other savanna systems are complicated by methodological differences among studies, the proportion of biomass consumed by Atta species is about 25\% of that consumed by the entire ungulate community in some African savannas and greater than or comparable to the total herbivory observed in some terrestrial ecosystems. Conclusions: We hypothesize that this intense biomass consumption by Atta will have important ecological consequences for the cerrado ecosystem, because leaf-cutter abundance increases in fragmented or degraded habitats. These effects are likely to be exacerbated as anthropogenic pressure in this biodiversity hotspot increases.},

Over the course of 5 years, we monitored two common Amazonian secondary forest species-Lacistema pubescens and Myrcia sylvatica-in dry-season irrigation, litter-removal and control plots. We then evaluated the effects of altered water and nutrient availability on population demography and dynamics using matrix models and life table response experiments. Our results show that despite prolonged experimental manipulation of water and nutrient availability, there were nearly no consistent and unidirectional treatment effects on the demography of either species. The patterns and significance of observed treatment effects were largely dependent on cross-year variability not related to rainfall patterns, and disappeared once we pooled data across years. Furthermore, most of these transient treatment effects had little effect on population growth rates. Our results suggest that despite major experimental manipulations of water and nutrient availability-factors considered critical to the ecology of tropical pioneer tree species-autogenic light limitation appears to be the primary regulator of tree demography at early/mid successional stages. Indeed, the effects of light availability may completely override those of other factors thought to influence the successional development of Amazonian secondary forests.},

In this system, variability in seedling recruitment events may best explain the extremely high small-scale species richness and its relationship to soil moisture and system net primary productivity. To understand the potential mechanistic controls on species richness, we used a long-term resource manipulation study across a natural soil moisture gradient to assess environmental controls on seedling recruitment. We considered the availability of resources to be an indicator of seedling safe-site supply, and also manipulated seed availability to examine the relative importance of recruitment limitations on seedling diversity. We found that water availability regulated the number of species in the seedling community regardless of the underlying natural moisture gradient, and that this effect may result from differential responses of seedling guilds to resource availability. Water supply was more important than seed supply in determining seedling establishment, suggesting that appropriate sites for regeneration are a factor limiting seedling success. This is the first study that shows that the episodic supply of microsites for recruitment could influence species richness in the highly threatened and biodiverse longleaf pine savanna.},

While experimental studies typically measure tolerance in response to the intensity of herbivory (i.e., the amount of leaf tissue removed in one attack), the impact of how many times plants are attacked during a growing season (i.e., the frequency of damage) is virtually unexplored. Using experimental defoliations that mimicked patterns of attack by leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.), we examined how the frequency of herbivory influenced plant tolerance traits in six tree species in Brazil's Cerrado. For 2 years we quantified how monthly and quarterly damage influenced individual survivorship, relative growth rate, plant architecture, flowering, and foliar chemistry. We found that the content of leaf nitrogen (N) increased among clipped individuals of most species, suggesting that Atta influences the allocation of resources in damaged plants. Furthermore, our clipping treatments affected tree architecture in ways thought to promote tolerance. However, none of our focal species exhibited a compensatory increase in growth (increment in trunk diameter) in response to herbivory as relative growth rates were significantly lower in clipped than in unclipped individuals. In addition, the probability of survival was much lower for clipped plants, and lower for plants clipped monthly than those clipped quarterly. For plants that did survive, simulated herbivory dramatically reduced the probability of flowering. Our results were similar across a phylogenetically distinct suite of species, suggesting a potential extendability of these findings to other plant species in this system.},

We used experimental manipulations with six woody plant species to elucidate the effects of seed predator type, habitat, and plant species identity on rates of seed predation and seedling recruitment in the Neotropical savannas known as the Cerrado. We found that seed predation rates are consistently high across a diversity of local habitat types, with important inter-habitat variation in seed predation for three of the six species used in our experiments. We also found that seed predation has a clear demographic signal - experimentally excluding predators resulted in higher rates of seedling establishment over the course of two seasons. Because the intensity of seed predation varied between species and habitats, it may play a role in structuring local patterns of plant abundance and community composition. Finally, our results lend support to the recent hypothesis that herbivores have major and underappreciated impacts in Neotropical savannas, and that top-down factors can influence the demography of plants in this extensive and biodiversity-rich biome in previously unexplored ways.},

We found that during this time period only 16\% of subject editors were women, with more pronounced disparities in positions of editorial leadership. Although the trend was towards improvement over time, there was surprising variation between journals, including those with similar disciplinary foci. While demographic changes in academia may reduce these disparities over time, we argue journals should proactively strive for gender parity on their editorial boards.

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Background: Ecosystem engineers are species that transform habitats in ways that influence other species.While the impacts of many engineers have been well described, our understanding of how their impact varies along environmental gradients remains limited. Although disentangling the effects of gradients and engineers on biodiversity is complicated-the gradients themselves can be altered by engineers-doing so is necessary to advance conceptual and mathematical models of ecosystem engineering. We used leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.) to investigate the relative influence of gradients and environmental engineers on the abundance and species richness of woody plants. Methods: We conducted our research in South America's Cerrado. With a survey of plant recruits along a canopy cover gradient, and data on environmental conditions that influence plant recruitment, we fit statistical models that addressed the following questions: (1) Does A. laevigata modify the gradient in canopy cover found in our Cerrado site? (2) Do environmental conditions that influence woody plant establishment in the Cerrado vary with canopy cover or proximity to A. laevigata nests? (3) Do A. laevigata and canopy cover act independently or in concert to influence recruit abundance and species richness? Results: We found that environmental conditions previously shown to influence plant establishment in the Cerrado varied in concert with canopy cover, but that ants are not modifying the cover gradient or cover over nests. However, ants are modifying other local environmental conditions, and the magnitude and spatial extent of these changes are consistent across the gradient. In contrast to prior studies, we found that ant-related factors (e.g., proximity to nests, ant changes in surface conditions), rather than canopy cover, had the strongest effect on the abundance of plant recruits. However, the diversity of plants was influenced by both the engineer and the canopy cover gradient. Discussion: Atta laevigata in the Cerrado modify local conditions in ways that have strong but spatially restricted consequences for plant communities. We hypothesize that ants indirectly reduce seedling establishment by clearing litter and reducing soil moisture, which leads to seed and seedling desiccation. Altering soil nutrients could also reduce juvenile growth and survivorship; if so these indirect negative effects of engineering could exacerbate their direct effects of harvesting plants. The effects of Atta appear restricted to nest mounds, but they could be long-lasting because mounds persist long after a colony has died or migrated. Our results support the hypothesis that leaf-cutter ants play a dominant role in Cerrado plant demography. We suggest the ecological and economic footprint of these engineers may increase dramatically in coming decades due to the transformation of the Cerrado by human activities.},

	abstract = {Ecologists commonly use matrix models to study the population dynamics of plants. Most studies of plant demography use plot-based methods to collect data, in part, because mapped individuals are easier to relocate in subsequent surveys and survey methods can be standardized among sites. However, there is tremendous variation among studies, both in terms of plot arrangement and the total area sampled. In addition, there has been little discussion of how alternative sampling arrangements influence estimates of population growth rates (lambda) calculated with matrix models. We surveyed the literature to determine what sampling designs are most used in studies of plant demography using matrix models. We then used simulations of three common sampling techniques-using a single randomly placed plot, multiple randomly placed plots, and systematically distributed plots-to evaluate how these alternative strategies influenced the precision of estimates of lambda. These simulations were based on long-term demographic data collected on 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminate (Heliconiaceae). We found that the method used to collect data did not affect the bias or precision of estimates in our system-a surprising result, since the advantage in efficiency that is gained from systematic sampling is a well-known result from sampling theory. Because the statistical advantage of systematic sampling is most evident when there is spatial structure in demographic vital rates, we attribute this result to the lack of spatially structured vital rates in our focal populations. Given the likelihood of spatial autocorrelation in most ecological systems, we advocate sampling with a systematic grid of plots in each study site, as well as that researchers ensure that enough area is sampled-both within and across sites-to encompass the range of spatial variation in plant survival, growth, and reproduction.},

Nevertheless, studies of editorial board composition remain rare, especially those focusing on journals publishing research in the increasingly globalized fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Using metrics for quantifying the diversity of ecological communities, we quantified international representation on the 1985-2014 editorial boards of 24 environmental biology journals. Over the course of 3 decades, there were 3,827 unique scientists based in 70 countries who served as editors. The size of the editorial community increased over time-the number of editors serving in 2014 was 4-fold greater than in 1985-as did the number of countries in which editors were based. Nevertheless, editors based outside the "Global North" (the group of economically developed countries with high per capita gross domestic product [GDP] that collectively concentrate most global wealth) were extremely rare. Furthermore, 67.18\% of all editors were based in either the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, geographic diversity-already low in 1985-remained unchanged through 2014. We argue that this limited geographic diversity can detrimentally affect the creativity of scholarship published in journals, the progress and direction of research, the composition of the STEM workforce, and the development of science in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia (i.e., the "Global South").},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Background: The dispersal ability of queens is central to understanding ant life-history evolution, and plays a fundamental role in ant population and community dynamics, the maintenance of genetic diversity, and the spread of invasive ants. In tropical ecosystems, species from over 40 genera of ants establish colonies in the stems, hollow thorns, or leaf pouches of specialized plants. However, little is known about the relative dispersal ability of queens competing for access to the same host plants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used empirical data and inverse modeling-a technique developed by plant ecologists to model seed dispersal-to quantify and compare the dispersal kernels of queens from three Amazonian ant species that compete for access to host-plants. We found that the modal colonization distance of queens varied 8-fold, with the generalist ant species (Crematogaster laevis) having a greater modal distance than two specialists (Pheidole minutula, Azteca sp.) that use the same host-plants. However, our results also suggest that queens of Azteca sp. have maximal distances that are four-sixteen times greater than those of its competitors. Conclusions/Significance: We found large differences between ant species in both the modal and maximal distance ant queens disperse to find vacant seedlings used to found new colonies. These differences could result from interspecific differences in queen body size, and hence wing musculature, or because queens differ in their ability to identify potential host plants while in flight. Our results provide support for one of the necessary conditions underlying several of the hypothesized mechanisms promoting coexistence in tropical plant-ants. They also suggest that for some ant species limited dispersal capability could pose a significant barrier to the rescue of populations in isolated forest fragments. Finally, we demonstrate that inverse models parameterized with field data are an excellent means of quantifying the dispersal of ant queens.},

	abstract = {Facilitative interactions between neighboring plants can influence community composition, especially in locations where environmental stress is a factor limiting competitive effects. The longleaf pine savanna of the southeastern United States is a threatened and diverse system where seedling recruitment success and understory species richness levels are regulated by the availability of moist microsites. We hypothesized that the dominant bunch grass species (Aristida stricta Michx.) would facilitate moist seedling microsites through shading, but that the effect would depend on stress gradients. Here, we examined the environmental properties modified by the presence of wiregrass and tested the importance of increased shade as a potential facilitative mechanism promoting seedling recruitment across spatial and temporal stress gradients. We showed that environmental gradients, season, and experimental water manipulation influence seedling success. Environmental properties were modified by wiregrass proximity in a manner that could facilitate seedling success, but we showed that shade alone does not provide a facilitative benefit to seedlings in this system.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Background: The organization of networks of interacting species, such as plants and animals engaged in mutualisms, strongly influences the ecology and evolution of partner communities. Habitat fragmentation is a globally pervasive form of spatial heterogeneity that could profoundly impact the structure of mutualist networks. This is particularly true for biodiversity-rich tropical ecosystems, where the majority of plant species depend on mutualisms with animals and it is thought that changes in the structure of mutualist networks could lead to cascades of extinctions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We evaluated effects of fragmentation on mutualistic networks by calculating metrics of network structure for ant-plant networks in continuous Amazonian forests with those in forest fragments. We hypothesized that networks in fragments would have fewer species and higher connectance, but equal nestedness and resilience compared to forest networks. Only one of the nine metrics we compared differed between continuous forest and forest fragments, indicating that networks were resistant to the biotic and abiotic changes that accompany fragmentation. This is partially the result of the loss of only specialist species with one connection that were lost in forest fragments. Conclusions/Significance: We found that the networks of ant-plant mutualists in twenty-five year old fragments are similar to those in continuous forest, suggesting these interactions are resistant to the detrimental changes associated with habitat fragmentation, at least in landscapes that are a mosaic of fragments, regenerating forests, and pastures. However, ant-plant mutualistic networks may have several properties that may promote their persistence in fragmented landscapes. Proactive identification of key mutualist partners may be necessary to focus conservation efforts on the interactions that insure the integrity of network structure and the ecosystems services networks provide.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas, but relatively few studies have analyzed how soil-and-litter dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other biogeochemical processes. Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in Central Brazil, we monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance of individual taxa, the richness of taxonomic groups, and the species richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site. However, both the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter availability and quality. In contrast, differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera were only detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site throughout most of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire-disturbed areas as a result of direct mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less favorable microclimate (i.e., increased litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there is evidence that the increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only 1-2 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod communities.},

Emoia cyanura and Emoia impar, recognized recently as cryptic species of skinks sympatric throughout much of the Pacific, are here each shown to be composed of several genetically distinct (on the basis of mitochondrial DNA sequences) but morphologically similar lineages. Furthermore, similarly coloured polymorphic individuals are found in both species, and these individuals have the same mtDNA haplotypes as their sympatric conspecifics. Although the morphological similarity of cryptic species is usually attributed to recent speciation, this is ruled out in the case of E. cyanura and E. impar, as both species are more closely related genetically to other currently recognized species than they are to each other. We suggest a genetic review of current Pacific skink systematics, given the possibility that morphologically indistinguishable populations may in fact represent cryptic species.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Secondary forests are an increasingly common feature in tropical landscapes worldwide and understanding their regeneration is necessary to design effective restoration strategies. It has previously been shown that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow different successional pathways according to the nature of past human activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests-those regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests is dependent on a site's post-clearing treatment. We recommend evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and implementing a restoration strategy, as this will influence the biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.},
